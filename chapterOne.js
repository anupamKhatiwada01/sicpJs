// The acts of the mind wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas are chiefly these three.
// 1. Combining all simple ideas into complex ones and thus all complex ideas are made.
// 2. Bringing two ideas whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take view of them at once, without uniting them into one.
// 3. The third is seperating them from all other ideas that accompany them in real existance: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

//  Exercise 1.2

// Declare a function that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of squares of the two larger numbers.

// Exercise 1.5
// Figure out is the interpreter used is using applicative-order evaluation or normal order evaluation
function p(){
  return p();
}

function test(x,y){
  return x===0?0:y;
}

// console.log(test(0,p()));
// We observe that the above line throws a stack overflow error
// In applicative order we need to evaluate the argument expressions first before we can evaluate the complete function.
// This will throw the error as the value of p() is erronous.
// In the normal order of execution on encountering the first argument as zero the interpreter would have run the function body first and the function would return 0.
// This shows that the node interpreter uses applicative order.

// Regular fibonacci (unoptimized) uses a number of steps that grows exponentially with input.
// On the other hand space required grows only linearly with input because we need to keep track of only the nodes above us in the tree at any point in the computation. In general, the number of steps in a tree recursive process will be proportiional
// to the number of nodes in the tree while the space required will be proportional to the maximum depth of the tree.
